# Performance Optimization Tips

The ACK Framework is designed for high performance out of the box, but there are always ways to squeeze more speed out of your application. This guide provides a collection of tips and strategies for optimizing your ACK applications.

## 1. Code Splitting is Key

The single most effective performance optimization is to reduce the amount of JavaScript that is downloaded and parsed on initial page load.

- **Split by Route:** Use the `@ack/loader`'s `ChunkManager` to associate specific JavaScript chunks with different routes. This ensures that users only download the code for the page they are currently visiting.

  ```javascript
  // Example: docs/guide/LAZY_LOADING_CODE_SPLITTING.md
  import { createChunkManager } from '@ack/loader';

  const manager = createChunkManager();
  manager.defineChunks('/dashboard', ['dashboard-layout', 'dashboard-charts']);
  manager.defineChunks('/profile', ['profile-layout', 'profile-details']);
  ```

- **Analyze Your Bundles:** Use tools like `rollup-plugin-visualizer` to inspect your bundles and identify large dependencies that could be split into separate chunks.

## 2. Lazy Load Everything You Can

Lazy loading defers the loading of non-critical assets until they are actually needed.

- **Components:** Lazy load components that are not immediately visible, such as modals, tooltips, or content that is below the fold.

  ```javascript
  import { createLazyLoader } from '@ack/loader';
  const loader = createLazyLoader();

  async function showModal() {
    const Modal = await loader.load('modal', () => import('../components/Modal.ack'));
    // ... render the modal
  }
  ```

- **Images:** Use the `loading="lazy"` attribute on `<img>` tags to defer the loading of off-screen images.

## 3. Prefetch Intelligently

Prefetching allows you to load assets for the next navigation in the background, making your application feel instantaneous.

- **Prefetch on Hover:** When a user hovers over a link, it's a strong signal that they might navigate to that page. Use this opportunity to preload the necessary assets.

  ```javascript
  // In your component
  <a href="/next-page" onmouseover={preloadNextPage}>Next Page</a>

  // In your script
  import { chunkManager } from './chunkManager'; // your chunk manager instance

  function preloadNextPage() {
    chunkManager.preloadRoute('/next-page');
  }
  ```

- **Use the Right Strategy:** The `@ack/loader`'s `Prefetcher` offers multiple strategies.
  - **`conservative`:** A good default that balances performance with resource usage.
  - **`idle`:** For non-critical assets like analytics or logging.
  - **`aggressive`:** Use with caution, as it can consume a lot of bandwidth.

## 4. Optimize Your Images

Images are often the largest assets on a web page.

- **Choose the Right Format:** Use modern image formats like WebP or AVIF, which offer better compression than JPEG or PNG.
- **Compress Your Images:** Use tools like `imagemin` or online services to reduce the file size of your images without sacrificing quality.
- **Serve Responsive Images:** Use the `<picture>` element or the `srcset` attribute to serve different image sizes based on the user's screen size and resolution.

---

## 5. Reduce Your Dependency Footprint

- **Audit Your Dependencies:** Regularly review your `package.json` and remove any dependencies that are no longer needed.
- **Choose Lightweight Alternatives:** When possible, choose smaller, more focused libraries over large, monolithic ones. For example, use `date-fns` instead of `moment.js`.
- **Tree-Shaking:** Ensure that your build process is configured to tree-shake unused code from your dependencies. Vite does this by default.

---

## 6. Caching

- **Leverage Browser Caching:** Configure your server to send appropriate `Cache-Control` headers for your assets.
- **Use `@ack/api` Caching:** The HTTP client has built-in caching for GET requests. Use it to avoid re-fetching data that hasn't changed.

  ```javascript
  const response = await api.get('/users', { cache: true });
  ```

By applying these optimization techniques, you can significantly improve the performance of your ACK Framework applications, leading to a better user experience and higher engagement.
