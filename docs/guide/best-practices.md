# ACK Framework Best Practices

This guide provides a set of best practices for developing applications with the ACK Framework. Following these recommendations will help you build applications that are scalable, maintainable, and performant.

## 1. Project Structure

A well-organized project structure is crucial for maintainability. We recommend the following structure:

```
/
├── src/
│   ├── components/      # Reusable UI components (e.g., Button.ack, Modal.ack)
│   ├── pages/           # Page components for routing (e.g., Home.ack, About.ack)
│   ├── services/        # API service layers (e.g., userService.js)
│   ├── utils/           # Utility functions
│   ├── main.js          # Application entry point
│   └── App.ack          # Root application component
├── docs/
├── package.json
└── vite.config.js
```

- **Keep components small and focused.** Each component should have a single responsibility.
- **Separate pages from reusable components.** This makes it easier to manage routing and component reuse.
- **Use a service layer for API interactions.** This decouples your components from the data fetching logic.

## 2. Component Design

- **Prefer props for parent-to-child communication.** This is the standard and most predictable way to pass data down the component tree.
- **Use events for child-to-parent communication.** A child component should emit events to notify its parent of changes or user interactions.
- **Avoid overly complex components.** If a component becomes too large or does too much, break it down into smaller, more manageable components.
- **Use descriptive names for props and events.** This makes your components easier to understand and use.

## 3. Routing

- **Leverage file-based routing.** The ACK Framework's router is designed to work seamlessly with your file structure. Place your page components in the `src/pages` directory.
- **Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns.** Authentication, logging, and data pre-fetching are all great candidates for middleware.
- **Protect routes with route guards.** Use `beforeEnter` guards to control access to specific routes based on user roles or authentication status.
- **Use nested routes for complex layouts.** This is ideal for dashboards, settings pages, and other multi-view interfaces.

## 4. API Integration

- **Create a centralized API client.** Use `createHttpClient` to create a single, reusable client for your entire application.
- **Use interceptors for common tasks.**
  - **Request interceptors:** Add authentication tokens, API keys, or custom headers.
  - **Response interceptors:** Handle data transformations or logging.
  - **Error interceptors:** Implement global error handling and reporting.
- **Use a service layer pattern.** Abstract your API calls into services (e.g., `userService`, `productService`). This makes your components cleaner and your data logic reusable.
- **Type-safe your API calls.** If you're using TypeScript, define interfaces for your API responses to catch errors at compile time.

---

## 5. Performance

- **Split your code by route.** The `ChunkManager` is the perfect tool for this. This ensures that users only download the code they need for the current page.
- **Lazy load non-critical components.** Use the `LazyLoader` to defer the loading of components that are not immediately visible (e.g., modals, off-screen content).
- **Prefetch assets intelligently.**
  - **On hover:** Preload the assets for the next page when a user hovers over a link.
  - **Conservatively:** Use the `conservative` or `idle` prefetching strategies to avoid blocking the main thread.
- **Monitor your bundle size.** Regularly analyze your application's bundle to identify large dependencies or opportunities for optimization.

---

## 6. State Management

- **For simple state, use component state.** For state that is local to a single component, there's no need for a complex state management library.
- **For shared state, consider a simple store pattern.** For state that needs to be shared across multiple components, a simple, reactive store object can be very effective.
- **Avoid global state when possible.** Overuse of global state can make your application harder to reason about and test.

By following these best practices, you'll be well on your way to building high-quality applications with the ACK Framework. Happy coding!
